## Abstract

This white paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of cloud computing adoption within Cameroonian businesses, government agencies, and educational institutions. Through a combination of survey data, interviews with industry leaders, and market analysis, we identify the primary drivers accelerating cloud uptake, such as the need for agility, cost optimization, and access to advanced technologies.

We also delve into the significant challenges hindering widespread adoption, including:
*   Infrastructure limitations (internet connectivity, power stability)
*   Skills gap and lack of local expertise
*   Data security and sovereignty concerns
*   Cost considerations in a price-sensitive market
*   Awareness and understanding of cloud benefits

The paper concludes with a set of strategic recommendations for policymakers, businesses, educational bodies, and community organizations like C5IN to foster a more conducive environment for cloud adoption. These include investments in digital infrastructure, targeted training programs, development of local data centers, and promotion of cloud-first policies.

**Keywords:** Cloud Computing, Cameroon, Digital Transformation, Technology Adoption, IoT, Edge Computing, Policy.
